# CS4110-Project
Tasks:

- Choose an algorithm for sorting an array of N 8-bit unsigned numbers

- Implement it in VHDL using an FSMD architecture

- Implement it in C using the Zynq platform

- Both implementations should be demostrated on the Zybo board

- Compare the two implementations (Cost, effectiveness etc.)

The sorting algorithms we have chosen to implement is: Bitonic Sort, Merge Sort and Radix Sort


Submission:
xxxx, yyyy and zzzz represent the different candidate numbers.
